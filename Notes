% Who am I talking to? Who is my audience?

I am talking mainly to the TEM society, and thus have to rationalize for them why the use of the TEM to study magnetic materials is actually useful and interesting, even though we are operating in low-mag mode. 

My secondary audience is materials scientists working with magnetic materials, and particularly artificial spin ice made from Permalloy. For this audience, the most interesting sections are the fabrication comparison (FIB vs EBL) and what differences there are in the actual ASI structure and their behaviour overall. Additionally, they'll be interested to see how TEM studies can bring any more information on the table as opposed to PEEM and other tools. Also, they need to be convinced that the TEM can produce valuable and easily interpretable results for them.


My field is rather disciplinary, mostly physicists and materials scientists are interested in my work. It is very much on the experimental side of physics, and I do not have to cater to the theoretical physicists - they will be hostile towards any theory I try to present and accepting of most experimental choices I have made.
Be wary of the assumptions you make about the knowledge of your audience!

% What do I want to say? What is my core argument?
Working title (22.02.2022):
Magnetic STEM-DPC imaging of artificial spin ice structures.

How can the STEM-DPC technique in the TEM be optimized for magnetic characterization of artificial spin ice structures?




% Try to explain d-scan?
% When the beam is scanned across the sample, it is moved in such a way that it is does not necessarily hit the detector in the same way at all times. This is termed d-scan and needs to be corrected for when processing the data. Luckily, the d-scan varies slowly across the image, such that a simple scheme which levels all four corners of the image in intensity is normally sufficient.
