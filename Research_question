% How can the STEM-DPC technique in the TEM be optimized for magnetic characterization of artificial spin ice structures?


Research question:
How can the ADF detector improve STEM-DPC imaging of ASI ensembles for dynamic experiments and magnetic characterisation , and what role does the fabrication method of the ASI ensembles play in the magnetic characterisation process?

Supplementary question:
How does the fabrication method of ASI ensembles impact the ability to do STEM-DPC with the 4D-STEM and ADF detectors respectively, and what physical and chemical differences are there between ASI ensembles fabricated by EBL patterning vs FIB milling?

Thesis statement:
The use of the ADF detector for STEM-DPC allows for in-situ experiments of the magnetisation dynamics of ASI ensembles due to the small data size and fast calculatability of these data.

Additionally, samples made by EBL patterning and lift-off introduce a number of disturbances which hinder magnetic characterisation, even though these magnets are better suited for studying ASI properties.
