	abstract = {Nanomagnet logic ({NML}) has received increasing attention as an alternative information processing technology given the potential for low energy dissipation, a relatively advanced experimental state of the art, and intangibles such as inherent radiation hardness and nonvolatility. In order to facilitate the integration of {NML}-based circuits with transistor-based circuits, a magnetic–electrical interface ({MEI}) is needed. This paper focuses on the output portion of {MEI} design, i.e., converting signals from the magnetic domain to the electrical domain. The basic idea of an {MEI} output is to employ fringing ﬁelds from an {NML} device to set the magnetization state of the free layer of a magnetic tunnel junction. A detailed study of four different {MEI} output designs is presented which considers metrics such as the clock energy required to set the output state, the magnetoresistance ratio, etc. Simulation-based analysis reveals the pros and cons of each design. A design where multiple {NML} devices (i.e., free layers) share a large synthetic antiferromagnet is most promising based on our simulation-based, quantitative analysis.},

	abstract = {Conventional bulk silicon is approaching its physical limit in the continued scaling of ﬁeld-effect transistors ({FETs}). To extend the scaling limit of silicon-{FETs}, 2-D silicon semiconductors are highly desired because of the atomic thickness and mature {CMOS}-compatibility. By employing the hybrid honeycomb-kagome (hhk)-silicene monolayer as transport channel, we study the performance of sub-5-nm p- and n-type {FETs} based on ab initio quantum transport simulations. The hhk-silicene {pFET} ({nFET}) can be scaled down to 2-nm (3 nm) gate length (Lg) with performances fulﬁlling the high-performance requirements of International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors ({ITRS}) for 2028 horizon. Besides, with Lg scales down to 3 nm, the subthreshold swing ({SS}) of the hhk-silicene {FETs} still can break the thermal limit of 60 {mV}/dec. The subthermal switches of hhk-silicene {FETs} beneﬁt from the relatively isolated bands near the Fermi level.

In this study, multiple quantum dot islands such as {GNS}-{CNT} and {GNS}-C60 are utilized in {SET} devices. The currents of two counterpart devices are modeled and analyzed. The impacts of important parameters such as temperature and applied gate voltage on the current of two {SETs} are investigated using proposed mathematical models. Moreover, the impacts of {CNT} length, fullerene diameter, {GNS} length, and {GNS} spiral length and number of turns on the {SET}’s current are explored. Additionally, the Coulomb blockade ranges ({CB}) of the two {SETs} are compared. The results reveal that the {GNS}-{CNT} {SET} has a lower Coulomb blockade range and a higher current than the {GNS}-C60 {SET}. Their charge stability diagrams indicate that the {GNS}-{CNT} {SET} has smaller Coulomb diamond areas, zero-current regions, and zero-conductance regions than the {GNS}-C60 {SET}.},

This sentiment changed upon the development of spintronics, where the electrons’ spin degree of freedom is utilized for new functionality in electronic devices. In this context antiferromagnets first found application as passive elements, where their insensitivity to applied magnetic fields allowed them to provide reference magnetic orientations via the exchange-bias effect. More recently it has been recognized that antiferromagnets can play a more active role in spintronics; namely they can generate, support, and manipulate spin currents. In fact, the magnetic structure of antiferromagnets may play a profound role in spin-transport phenomena, giving rise to new transport phenomena. We will briefly review both the passive and active roles that antiferromagnets may play for spintronics and provide a perspective for future opportunities.},

However, spintronics faces a number of challenges, including spin generation and injection, long distance spin transport, and manipulation and detection of spin orientation. In solving these issues, new concepts and spintronics materials were proposed one after another, such as half metals, spin gapless semiconductors, and bipolar magnetic semiconductors. Topological insulators can also be viewed as a special class of spintronics materials, with their surface states used for pure spin generation and transportation. In designing these spintronics materials, first-principles calculations play a very important role. This article attempts to give a brief review of the basic principles and theoretical design of these materials. Meanwhile, we also give some attentions to the antiferromagnetic spintronics, which is mainly based on antiferromagnets and has aroused much interest in recent years.},

            Quantitative characterization of intrinsic and artificial defects in ferromagnetic structures is critical to future magnetic storage based on vortices or domain walls moving through nanostructured devices. Using torsional magnetometry, we observe finite size modifications to the Barkhausen effect in the limiting case of a single vortex core interacting with individual pointlike pinning sites in a magnetic thin film. The Barkhausen effect in this limit becomes a quantitative two-dimensional nanoscale probe of local energetics in the film. Tailoring the pinning potential using single-point focused ion beam implantation demonstrates control of the effect and points the way to integrated magneto-mechanical devices incorporating quantum pinning effects.},

The materials were exposed to an intense electron probe by aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy ({STEM}) with simultaneous acquisition of electron energy loss spectroscopy ({EELS}) data. Electron beam damage was identified by changes of the core loss fine structure after quantification by a refined and improved model based approach. At 200kV acceleration voltage, damage in {SrTiO}3 was identified by changes both in the {EEL} fine structure and by contrast changes in the {STEM} images. However, the changes in the {STEM} image contrast as introduced by minor damage can be difficult to detect under several common experimental conditions. No damage was observed in {SrTiO}3 at 80kV acceleration voltage, independent of probe current and exposure time. In La0.7Sr0.3MnO3, beam damage was observed at both 80 and 200kV acceleration voltages. This damage was observed by large changes in the {EEL} fine structure, but not by any detectable changes in the {STEM} images. The typical method to validate if damage has been introduced during acquisitions is to compare {STEM} images prior to and after spectroscopy.

Each island of the spin ice has a three-component Heisenberg-like dipole moment subject to shape anisotropies that inﬂuence its direction. The model has real dynamics, including rotation of the magnetic degrees of freedom, going beyond the Isingtype models of spin ice. The dynamics is studied using a Langevin equation solved via a second-order Heun algorithm. Thermodynamic properties such as the speciﬁc heat are presented for different couplings. A peak in speciﬁc heat is related to a type of melting-like phase transition present in the model.

	abstract = {A rigorous treatment of image formation, taking into account inelastic scattering and partially coherent illumination, is given for the {CTEM}. The results also hold for a {STEM} if the momentum vectors of the incident and outgoing waves are interchanged and the flight direction of the electrons is reversed. A generalized optical theorem is found which connects the {antiFriedel} part of the elastic scattering amplitude with the squares of the elastic and inelastic scattering amplitudes. This theorem has important consequences for all approximation methods. For example, it shows that inelastic scattering influences the elastic scattering amplitude. It is further shown that the observed wings in optical diffractograms, obtained from micrographs of amorphous material taken using tilted beam illumination, can only be explained if double scattering (elastic and inelastic) is assumed. Hollow-cone illumination strongly suppresses the structural noise in the phase contrast image. The corresponding phase contrast transfer function ({PCTF}) is calculated for two different cone angles, assuming that no beam-limiting aperture is present. In addition, the {PCTFs} of a corrected microscope are calculated for two different illumination modes, one yielding negative and the other positive phase contrast. Finally, the contrast transfer has been investigated for a {STEM} operating with a split detector.},

	abstract = {The abundance of data to be processed calls for new computing paradigms, which could accommodate, and directly map artificial neural network architectures at the hardware level. Neuromorphic computing has emerged as a potential solution, proposing the implementation of artificial neurons and synapses on physical substrates. Conventionally, neuromorphic platforms are deployed in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology. However, such implementations still cannot compete with the highly energy-efficient performance of the brain. This calls for novel ultra-low-power nano-scale devices with the possibility of upscaling for the implementation of complex networks. In this paper, a multi-state spin−orbit torque ({SOT}) synapse based on the three-terminal perpendicular anisotropy magnetic tunnel junction (P-{MTJ}) is proposed. In this implementation, P-{MTJs} use common heavy metals but with different cross-section areas, thereby creating multiple states that can be harnessed to implement synapses. The proposed multi-state {SOT} synapse can solve the state-limited issue of spin-based synapses. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed multi-state {SOT} synapse can be programmed to reproduce the spike-timing-dependent plasticity learning algorithm.},

Little attention has been paid, however, to the fact that this technique is also capable of measuring electric ﬁelds. An application of the technique to measure piezoelectric polarization ﬁelds inside multi-layered structures such as quantum wells is demonstrated. For this purpose, piezoelectric ﬁelds within noncentrosymmetric crystal structures, based on {GaN}/{InGaN}/{GaN} quantum wells, are investigated. It can be shown that the technique is sensitive to these ﬁelds and yields detailed information about the ﬁeld distribution. The speciﬁc information and experimental limitations as well as artefacts of the technique will be discussed in detail and ﬁrst measurements are shown. The main advantages turn out to be high sensitivity for electric ﬁelds, combined with a very high resolution, which is limited only by the {STEM} probe size. Another advantage is the large achievable ﬁeld of view.},

Initial results from a charged coupled device ({CCD}) camera demonstrate the highly efﬁcient nature of this improvement over previous methods. Further hardware development with the use of a direct radiation detector, the Medipix3, also shows the possibilities where the reduction in collection time is more than an order of magnitude compared to the {CCD}. We show that this allows subpixel measurement of the beam deﬂection due to the magnetic induction.

Here we investigate and compare three diﬀerent scan patterns, making use of a programmable scan engine that allows to arbitrarily set the sequence of probe positions that are consecutively visited on the sample. We compare the typical raster scan with a so-called ‘snake’ pattern where the scan direction is reversed after each row and a novel Hilbert scan pattern that changes scan direction rapidly and provides an homogeneous treatment of both scan directions. We experimentally evaluate the imaging performance on a single crystal test sample by varying dwell time and evaluating behaviour with respect to sample drift. We demonstrate the ability of the Hilbert scan pattern to more faithfully represent the high frequency content of the image in the presence of sample drift. It is also shown that Hilbert scanning provides reduced bias when measuring lattice parameters from the obtained scanned images while maintaining similar precision in both scan directions which is especially important when e.g. performing strain analysis. Compared to raster scanning with ﬂyback correction, both snake and Hilbert scanning beneﬁt from dose reduction as only small probe movement steps occur.},

A simple route to minimize both the total electron-dose and the dose-rate is to reduce the electron beam-current and/or raster the probe at higher speeds. At the limit of these settings, and with current detectors, the resulting images suffer from unacceptable artifacts, including signal-streaking, detector-afterglow, and poor signal-to-noise ratios ({SNRs}). In this article, we present an alternative approach to capture dark-field {STEM} images by pulse-counting individual electrons as they are scattered to the annular dark-field ({ADF}) detector. Digital images formed in this way are immune from analog artifacts of streaking or afterglow and allow clean, high-{SNR} images to be obtained even at low beam-currents. We present results from both a {ThermoFisher} {FEI} Titan G2 operated at 300 {kV} and a Nion {UltraSTEM}200 operated at 200 {kV}, and compare the images to conventional analog recordings. {ADF} data are compared with analog counterparts for each instrument, a digital detector-response scan is performed on the Titan, and the overall rastering efficiency is evaluated for various scanning parameters.},

Unfortunately, for scans with short pixel dwell-times (less than 5 μs), line flyback time represents an increasingly wasteful overhead. Although beam exposure during flyback causes damage while yielding no useful information, scan coil hysteresis means that eliminating it entirely leads to unacceptably distorted images. In this work, we reduce this flyback to an absolute minimum by calibrating and correcting for this hysteresis in postprocessing. Substantial improvements in dose efficiency can be realized (up to 20\%), while crystallographic and spatial fidelity is maintained for displacement/strain measurement.},

	abstract = {Scanning transmission electron microscopy ({STEM}) has emerged as one of the foremost techniques to analyze materials at atomic resolution. However, two practical difficulties inherent to {STEM} imaging are: radiation damage imparted by the electron beam, which can potentially damage or otherwise modify the specimen and slow-scan image acquisition, which limits the ability to capture dynamic changes at high temporal resolution. Furthermore, due in part to scan flyback corrections, typical raster scan methods result in an uneven distribution of dose across the scanned area. A method to allow extremely fast scanning with a uniform residence time would enable imaging at low electron doses, ameliorating radiation damage and at the same time permitting image acquisition at higher frame-rates while maintaining atomic resolution. The practical complication is that rastering the {STEM} probe at higher speeds causes significant image distortions. Non-square scan patterns provide a solution to this dilemma and can be tailored for low dose imaging conditions. Here, we develop a method for imaging with alternative scan patterns and investigate their performance at very high scan speeds. A general analysis for spiral scanning is presented here for the following spiral scan functions: Archimedean, Fermat, and constant linear velocity spirals, which were tested for {STEM} imaging. The quality of spiral scan {STEM} images is generally comparable with {STEM} images from conventional raster scans, and the dose uniformity can be improved.},

It is only recently with advancements in electron and atomic force microscopy instrumentation that the complex nature of these 2D entities can be probed. In this Research Update, the advances in aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy applied to ferroelectric topological defects are summarized. We discuss sub-atomic imaging and diffraction techniques used to observe changes in polarization, chemical composition, charge density, and strain at {DWs} and vortices. We further highlight the current achievements in mapping the 3D nature of ferroelectric polar skyrmions and in situ biasing. This Review will focus on both the fundamental physics of {DW} and polar vortex formation and their dynamics. Finally, we discuss how electron spectroscopy can be used to relate the quantiﬁed structural distortions of polar topological entities to changes in their oxidation state and band structure.},

At angles around 45\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{o\}\$, the antiferromagnetic ordering changes to ferromagnetic and the magnetic configurations of the system exhibit near-degeneracy, making it particularly sensitive to small perturbations. We investigate through micromagnetic modelling the influence of dipolar fields produced by physically extended islands in field-driven magnetisation processes in pinwheel arrays, and compare the results to hysteresis experiments performed in-situ using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. We find that magnetisation end-states induce a Heisenberg pseudo-exchange interaction that governs both the inter-island coupling and the resultant array reversal process. Symmetry reduction gives rise to anisotropies and array-corner mediated avalanche reversals through a cascade of nearest-neighbour ({NN}) islands. The symmetries of the anisotropy axes are related to those of the geometrical array but are misaligned to the array axes as a result of the correlated interactions between neighbouring islands. The {NN} dipolar coupling is reduced by decreasing the island size and, using this property, we track the transition from the strongly coupled regime towards the pure point dipole one and observe modification of the ferromagnetic array reversal process. Our results shed light on important aspects of the interactions in pinwheel {ASI}, and demonstrate a mechanism by which their properties may be tuned for use in a range of fundamental research and spintronic applications.},

Here, we investigate a continuum of spin ice geometries, parameterised by rotation of the islands. In doing so, we morph from the classic square ice to the recently studied pinwheel geometry, with the rotation angle acting as a proxy for controlling inter-island interactions. We experimentally observe a change in ground state magnetic order from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic across this class of geometries using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy on thermally annealed cobalt arrays. The change in ordering leads to an apparent change in the nature of the defects supported: from one-dimensional strings in the antiferromagnetic phase to two-dimensional vortex-like structures in the ferromagnetic one, consistent with the scaling predicted by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Our results show how magnetic order in artificial spin ices can be tuned by changes in geometry so that a truly frustrated ice-rule phase is possible in two-dimensional systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate this system as a testbed to investigate out-of-equilibrium dynamics across phases.},

A periodic magnetic domain structure can be stabilized in sub-200 nm wide linear as well as curved magnets, embedded within a flat non-ferromagnetic thin film. The nanomagnets are produced within a non-ferromagnetic B2-ordered Fe60Al40 thin film, where local irradiation by a focused ion beam causes the formation of disordered and strongly ferromagnetic regions of A2 Fe60Al40. An anisotropic lattice relaxation is observed, such that the in-plane lattice parameter is larger when measured parallel to the magnet short-axis as compared to its length. This in-plane structural anisotropy manifests a magnetic anisotropy contribution, generating an easy-axis parallel to the short axis. The competing effect of the strain and shape anisotropies stabilizes a periodic domain pattern in linear as well as spiral nanomagnets, providing a versatile and geometrically controllable path to engineering the strain and thereby the magnetic anisotropy at the nanoscale.},

At low ﬁelds, magnetization ripple in the Co ﬁlms showed higher magnetic contrast and angular distribution than in the {NiFe} ﬁlms, which was due to the high anisotropy of Co. The {NiFe} ﬁlms reversed via rapid wall motion while the Co ﬁlms reversed mainly via slow moment rotation followed by wall motion. It is conﬁrmed that domain wall mobility in the {NiFe} ﬁlms is higher than that in the Co ﬁlms.

However, Dirac strings in 2D artificial spin ices bind magnetic charges, while 3D dipolar counterparts require cryogenic temperatures for their stability. Here, we present a micromagnetic study of a highly frustrated 3D artificial spin ice harboring tension-free Dirac strings with unbound magnetic charges at room temperature. We use micromagnetic simulations to demonstrate that the mobility threshold for magnetic charges is by 2 {eV} lower than their unbinding energy.

Here, we use Fresnel imaging to study the reversal process in “pinwheel” artiﬁcial spin ice, a modiﬁed square {ASI} structure obtained by rotating each island by some angle about its midpoint. Our results demonstrate that a simple 45° rotation changes the magnetic ordering from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic, creating a superferromagnet which exhibits mesoscopic domain growth mediated by domain wall nucleation and coherent domain propagation. We observe several domainwall conﬁgurations, most of which are direct analogues to those seen in continuous ferromagnetic ﬁlms. However, charged walls also appear due to the geometric constraints of the system. Changing the orientation of the external magnetic ﬁeld allows control of the nature of the spin reversal with the emergence of either one- or two-dimensional avalanches. This property of pinwheel {ASI} could be employed to tune devices based on magnetotransport phenomena such as Hall circuits.},

This is about 200 times as great as the permeability of the best iron for these low magnetizing fields. This high permeability is attendant upon proper heat treatment and also upon other factors among which is freedom from elastic strain. The presence of other elements than iron or nickel and specially carbon, reduces the permeability, but slight variations in heat treatment produce large changes compared with those due to small quantities of impurities. So far as discovered, other physical properties show no peculiarities at the composition which brings out the remarkable magnetic properties of permalloy. The equilibrium diagram, electric conductivity, crystal structure, mean spacing between adjacent atom centers and density are among the physical properties which have been studied. To the engineer in electrical communication the development of permalloy is very significant.

Rectangles are patterned into permalloy thin ﬁlms grown on Si substrates by means of electron-beam lithography and focused ion-beam ({FIB}) milling down to 100 nm dimensions. In this study, we analyse the effect of the {FIB} milling parameters (ion current, spot size, dose) on the resulting magnetic domain structures. The ion currents have been varied between 10 {pA} and 10 000 {pA}; the dose of the ion beam used for milling was varied in order to achieve the best deﬁnition for the milled areas. The resulting edges of the permalloy structures are characterized by means of {AFM}. We ﬁnd that a small ion dose does not affect the resulting magnetic domain patterns in the structures, so {FIB} milling can be applied to create high-quality permalloy nanostructures.},

	abstract = {In the last decades, mathematical and computational models have become ubiquitous to the field of systems biology. Specifically, the multiscale nature of biological processes makes the design and simulation of such models challenging. In this thesis we offer a perspective on available methods to study and simulate such models and how they can be combined to handle biological processes evolving at different scales.  The contribution of this thesis is threefold. First, we introduce Orchestral, a multiscale modular framework to simulate multicellular models. By decoupling intracellular chemical kinetics, cell-cell signaling, and cellular mechanics by means of operator-splitting, it is able to combine existing software into one massively parallel simulation.  Its modular structure makes it easy to replace its components, e.g. to adjust the level of modeling details. We demonstrate the scalability of our framework on both high performance clusters and in a cloud environment.  We then explore how center-based models can be used to study cellular mechanics in biological tissues. We show how modeling and numerical choices can affect the results of the simulation and mislead modelers into incorrect biological conclusions if these errors are not monitored properly. We then propose {CBMOS}, a Python framework specifically designed for the numerical study of such models.  Finally, we study how spatial details in intracellular chemical kinetics can be efficiently approximated in a multiscale compartment-based model. We evaluate how this model compares to two other alternatives in terms of accuracy and computational cost. We then propose a computational pipeline to study and compare such models in the context of Bayesian parameter inference and illustrate its usage in three case studies.},

	abstract = {In this topical review, we present key results of studies on magnetization dynamics in artificial spin ice ({ASI}), which are arrays of magnetically interacting nanostructures. Recent experimental and theoretical progress in this emerging area, which is at the boundary between research on frustrated magnetism and high-frequency studies of artificially created nanomagnets, is reviewed. The exploration of {ASI} structures has revealed fascinating discoveries in correlated spin systems. Artificially created spin ice lattices offer unique advantages as they allow for a control of the interactions between the elements by their geometric properties and arrangement. Magnonics, on the other hand, is a field that explores spin dynamics in the gigahertz frequency range in magnetic micro- and nanostructures. In this context, magnonic crystals are particularly important as they allow the modification of spinwave properties and the observation of band gaps in the resonance spectra. Very recently, there has been considerable progress, experimentally and theoretically, in combining aspects of both fields—artificial spin ice and magnonics—enabling new functionalities in magnonic and spintronic applications using {ASI}, as well as providing a deeper understanding of geometrical frustration in the gigahertz range. Different approaches for the realization of {ASI} structures and their experimental characterization in the high-frequency range are described and the appropriate theoretical models and simulations are reviewed. Special attention is devoted to linking these findings to the quasi-static behavior of {ASI} and dynamic investigations in magnonics in an effort to bridge the gap between both areas further and to stimulate new research endeavors.},

This superb new textbook presents a logical account of these ideas, staring from basic concepts in electromagnetsim and quantum mechanics. It outlines the origin of magnetic moments in atoms and how these moments can be affected by their local environment inside a crystal. The different types of interactions which can be present between magnetic moments are described. The final chapters of the book are devoted to the magnetic properties of metals, and to the complex behaviour which can occur when competing magnetic interactions are present and/or the system has a reduced dimensionality. Throughout the text, the theorectical principles are applied to real systems. There is substantial discussion of experimental techniques and current reserach topics.

This leads to estimations of effective anisotropy constants for (1) the easy axis along the particle’s long direction, and (2) the hard axis along the particle’s thin direction. A spin relaxation algorithm together with fast Fourier transform for the demagnetization ﬁeld is used to solve the micromagnetics problem for a thin system. The magnetic hysteresis is also found. The results indicate some possibilities for controlling the equilibrium and dynamics in spin ice materials by using different island geometries.},

In general, Lorentz microscopy is advantageous for real time observation and disadvantageous for quantitative analysis comparing with electron holography, and vice versa. However, a number of techniques have been developed to overcome these disadvantages, which include Foucault mode, Lorentz phase microscopy, real time electron holography and multi wave interferometry. A formula for Lorentz phase microscopy, which coincides with that of {TIE}, was derived newly using a weak phase approximation. High-precise electron holography, phase-shifting holography and differential holography were shown with mathematical treatments and applications. The phase-shifting holography reconstructed the image of multilayers with better quality than the Fourier method. Two-dimensional differentiation of the electron phase is effective to reveal magnetic induction directly. Differential holography using an electron trapezoidal prism is also useful to reveal structures especially in the case where a well-defined reference wave is difficult to obtain. Since {TEM} method such as Lorentz microscopy and electron holography can observe inside the specimen, they are favorable for specimens whose inside structure might be different from the surface like magnetic structures. Improving techniques to image nano-magnetic structures should encourage the development of new magnetic materials and devices.},

	abstract = {Magnetricity, the magnetic equivalent of electricity, was recently veriﬁed experimentally for the ﬁrst time. Indeed, like the stream of electric charges that produces electric current, emergent magnetic monopoles have been observed to roam freely in geometrically frustrated magnets known as spin ice. However, such phenomena demand extreme physical conditions, say, a single spin ice crystal has to be cooled to very low temperature, around 0.36 K. Candidates to overcome this difﬁculty are their artiﬁcial analogues, the so-called artiﬁcial spin ices. Here, we demonstrate that a speciﬁc unidirectional arrangement of nanoislands yields a peculiar system where magnetic monopoles emerge and are constrained to move along aligned dipoles, providing an ordered ﬂow of magnetic charges at room temperature.},

	abstract = {Phase transitions and critical phenomena have consistently been among the principal subjects of active studies in statistical physics. The simple act of transforming one state of matter or phase into another, for instance by changing the temperature, has always captivated the curious mind. This book provides an introductory account on the theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena, a subject now recognized to be indispensable for students and researchers from many fields of physics and related disciplines. The first five chapters are very basic and quintessential, and cover standard topics such as mean-field theories, the renormalization group and scaling, universality, and statistical field theory methods. The remaining chapters develop more advanced concepts, including conformal field theory, the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, the effects of randomness, percolation, exactly solvable models, series expansions, duality transformations, and numerical techniques. Moreover, a comprehensive series of appendices expand and clarify several issues not developed in the main text. The important role played by symmetry and topology in understanding the competition between phases and the resulting emergent collective behaviour, giving rise to rigidity and soft elementary excitations, is stressed throughout the book. Serious attempts have been directed toward a self-contained modular approach so that the reader does not have to refer to other sources for supplementary information. Accordingly, most of the concepts and calculations are described in detail, sometimes with additional/auxiliary descriptions given in appendices and exercises. The latter are presented as the topics develop with solutions found at the end of the book, thus giving the text a self-learning character.},

	abstract = {Focused ion beam ({FIB}) milling is a common fabrication technique to make nanostencil masks which has the unintended consequence of gallium ion implantation surrounding milled features in silicon nitride membranes. We observe major changes in ﬁlm structure, chemical composition, and magnetic behaviour of permalloy nanostructures deposited by electron beam evaporation using silicon nitride stencil masks made by a {FIB} as compared to stencil masks made by regular lithography techniques. We characterize the stenciled structures and both types of masks using transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, magnetic force microscopy and kelvin probe force microscopy. All these techniques demonstrate distinct differences at a length scale of a 1–100 nm for the structures made using stencil mask fabricated using a {FIB}. The origin of these differences seems to be related to the presence of implanted ions, a detailed understanding of the mechanism however remains to be developed.},

Exploring 2D electronic materials with suitable band gap and high mobility is key to designing ultra-scaled devices. The electronic properties and device performance of sub-10 nm 2D Sb2Te2Se are studied by ab initio quantum-transport simulations. The results show that 2D Sb2Te2Se, a stable system, possesses an indirect bandgap of 1.01 {eV} and high electron mobility exceeding 103 cm2 V−1 s−1. Through comparing with the ballistic quantum transports of Sb2Te2Se, the n-metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor ({MOSFET}) exhibits better device performance than p-{MOSFET}. In particular, not only can the on-current of n-{MOSFET} with gate length Lg = 9 nm reach as high as 1660 µA µm−1, but its other figures of merit including gate capacity (0.72 {fF} µm−1), delay time (0.31 ps), and power dissipation (0.37 {fJ} µm−1) also satisfy the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors 2020 requirements. Therefore, 2D Sb2Te2Se could become a potential electronic material for next-generation nanodevices.},

	abstract = {Lithographic processing and ﬁlm growth technologies are continuing to advance, so that it is now possible to create patterned ferroic materials consisting of arrays of sub-1 µm elements with high deﬁnition. Some of the most fascinating behaviour of these arrays can be realised by exploiting interactions between the individual elements to create new functionality. The properties of these artiﬁcial ferroic systems differ strikingly from those of their constituent components, with novel emergent behaviour arising from the collective dynamics of the interacting elements, which are arranged in speciﬁc designs and can be activated by applying magnetic or electric ﬁelds. We ﬁrst focus on artiﬁcial spin systems consisting of arrays of dipolar-coupled nanomagnets and, in particular, review the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial spin ice, which demonstrates a wide range of fascinating phenomena arising from the frustration inherent in particular arrangements of nanomagnets, including emergent magnetic monopoles, domains of ordered macrospins, and novel avalanche behaviour. We outline how demagnetisation protocols have been employed as an effective thermal anneal in an attempt to reach the ground state, comment on phenomena that arise in thermally activated systems and discuss strategies for selectively generating speciﬁc conﬁgurations using applied magnetic ﬁelds. We then move on from slow ﬁeld and temperature driven dynamics to high frequency phenomena, discussing spinwave excitations in the context of magnonic crystals constructed from arrays of patterned magnetic elements. At high frequencies, these arrays are studied in terms of potential applications including magnetic logic, linear and non-linear microwave optics, and fast, efﬁcient switching, and we consider the possibility to create tunable magnonic crystals with artiﬁcial spin ice. Finally, we discuss how functional ferroic composites can be incorporated to realise magnetoelectric effects. Speciﬁcally, we discuss artiﬁcial multiferroics (or multiferroic composites), which hold promise for new applications that involve electric ﬁeld control of magnetism, or electric and magnetic ﬁeld responsive devices for high frequency integrated circuit design in microwave and terahertz signal processing. We close with comments on how enhanced functionality can be realised through engineering of nanostructures with interacting ferroic components, creating opportunities for novel spin electronic devices that, for example, make use of the transport of magnetic charges, thermally activated elements, and reprogrammable nanomagnet systems.},

It achieves the ultra steep sub-threshold slope ({SS}) due to the cumulative effect of weak impact-ionization induced positive feedback and electrostatic modulation of Schottky barrier heights at both source and drain terminals. It consists of axial nanowire heterostructure (silicide-intrinsic silicon-silicide) with three independent all-around gates, two gates are polarity control gates for dynamically reconﬁguring the device polarity by modulating the effective Schottky barrier heights and a control gate switches the device {ON} and {OFF}. The most interesting features of the proposed structure are simpliﬁed fabrication process as the state-of-the-art for ion implantation and high thermal budget no more required for annealing. It is highly immune to process variations, doping control issues and random dopant ﬂuctuations ({RDF}) and there are no mobility degradation issues related to high doping. A calibrated 3-D {TCAD} simulation results exhibit the {SS} of 2 {mV}/dec for n-type E-{SiNW}-{SB}-{FET} and 9 {mV}/dec for p-type E-{SiNW}-{SB}-{FET} for about ﬁve decades of current. Further, it resolves all the reliability related issues of {IMOS} as hot electron effects are no more limiting our device performance. It offers signiﬁcant drive current of the order of 10À5-10À4 A and magniﬁcently high {ION}/{IOFF} ratio of {\textasciitilde}108 along with the inherent advantages of symmetric device structure for its circuit realization.},
